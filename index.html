            <br><br> The
            reason being I love solving problems and having an infinite number of possibilities when customizing a car.
            Paint, wheels, body work, and performance enhancements all change the look, feel, and attitude of the car.
            It ultimately gives the car a personality that reflects who you are and the style you have. Similar to UI
            design, the style and features of a website or app drastically change the tone and attitude.

            <p>NAMI OC is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to positively impacting Orange County families who
                deal with mental disabilities. They are dedicated to promoting events such as walks to raise money and
                awareness of mental illnesses. We believe that their public image suffers from a lack of a dynamic
                website
                in a digital era.

                By re-designing their website to highlight their support programs and motivate visitors to donate or
                participate in their fundraising events, the organization can increase its productivity and extend their
                reach within the county.

            <p>We believe that special deals like happy hour for food and drinks make outings more enticing and make
                gathering more enjoyable for people in their social experiences, hence the birth of MappyHour! MappyHour
                was
                designed to make the process of finding happy hour specials effortless for our users striving
                to save money. We have observed that existing apps are not meeting the usersâ€™ need to browse food and
                drink
                deals, which is causing our users to not go out as frequently or to spend over their budget when they do
                go
                out.
