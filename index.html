            <h1 class="showHeading">NAMI OC Redesign</h1>
            <p>NAMI OC is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to positively impacting Orange County families who
                deal with mental disabilities. They are dedicated to promoting events such as walks to raise money and
                awareness of mental illnesses. We believe that their public image suffers from a lack of a dynamic
                website
                in a digital era.

                By re-designing their website to highlight their support programs and motivate visitors to donate or
                participate in their fundraising events, the organization can increase its productivity and extend their
                reach within the county.

        <h1 class="showHeading">Mappy Hour</h1>
        <p>We believe that special deals like happy hour for food and drinks make outings more enticing and make
            gathering more enjoyable for people in their social experiences, hence the birth of MappyHour! MappyHour was
            designed to make the process of finding happy hour specials effortless for our users striving
            to save money. We have observed that existing apps are not meeting the usersâ€™ need to browse food and drink
            deals, which is causing our users to not go out as frequently or to spend over their budget when they do go
            out.

        <p>Summary of what I did and what the Department of Homeland and Security does and what the team of 2 of us did.
            Maybe something about the time it took and
            the restrictions. End with future ideas or whatever idk</p>
